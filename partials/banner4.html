    <h2>New Hampshire Discoveries</h2>

    <p>The inquiry continues into "suspected violations of the fiduciary and contractual obligations of the Directors, members of the Committee on Finance ... and/or other officers of The Mother church, including possible misuse and gross mismanagement of the Trusts' assets ..." (See Summer 2015 Banner)</p>

    <p>The attorneys representing unnamed members of The Mother church have discovered significant breaches of Mrs Eddy's deeds of trust filed with the probate court of New Hampshire.  They are detailed in 324 pages of violations and noncompliance by current and former trustees.</p>

    <p>In 1972, the copyrights to Mary Baker Eddy's writings were stripped from her Will and deeds of trusts and transferred to The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston.  In the November 1976 Christian Science Journal, the Directors stated, "For a long time the Directors felt that some way should be found to carry out Mrs Eddy's wish that the rights of publication be placed in her Church rather than in a trust administered by a court." (p 657)  There is no evidence that Mrs Eddy ever stated any such "wish".  She devoted considerable time to meticulously establishing her deeds of trust from the first in 1892 until the final one in 1907.</p>

    <p>Originally she appointed her cousin General Henry M Baker as one of her trustees.  On his passing she appointed Josiah F Fernald as a sixth trustee who served as administrator until his passing in 1949.  He was president of Concord's National State Capital Bank.  Neither was a Christian Scientist.  Mrs Eddy once remarked, "Mr Fernald, you are a better Christian Scientist than many of my students because you are a better Christian."</p>

    <p>Mr Fernald later wrote, "I am not a follower of the Christian Science faith but make this statement as a citizen of Concord who wishes to see the things that are true, the things that are honest and the things that are just prevail." (MBE: The Years of Authority by Robert Peel, pp 473, 474)  The practice of appointing a disinterested sixth trustee was discontinued with the passing of Mr Fernald in 1949.  I Reed Gourley was an officer in Mr Fernald's bank and served Mrs Eddy's trust as treasurer/administrator, but he was never made a trustee.  No independent administrator has been appointed since 1971.  The next year, Mrs Eddy's copyrights were stripped from her New Hampshire trust.</p>

    <h2>HEALING AMONG THE INDIAN</h2>

    <p>A testimony by Martha Sutton Thompson in the August 1901 Christian Science Journal is presented for readers:</p>

    <p>"Several years ago I was requested by a young Indian to treat his sister for consumption in an advanced stage.  Two weeks afterwards I again visited the town of Walhalla, at the foot of the Pembina Mountains, and in these mountains the Indians lived.  An Indian boy was in town with horse and buggy in the hope of taking me out to the settlement to see some others who were ill with various diseases.  I told him I was going on to Winnipeg the next morning and would have to make the visit that night if I went.  He assured me they would all be awaiting me at his father's cabin.</p>

    <p>"We started across the mountains after ten o'clock at night.  After a five mile drive we arrived at his home, - a log structure about twenty feet square daubed with clay and roofed with sod.  When I went into the dimly-lighted but cleanly apartment, I found nineteen dusky patients squatted in a circle against the walls waiting to be healed.  They said Rosalie had recovered so rapidly that they knew it was the work of the Great Spirit, and so they all wanted to be healed.</p>

    <p>"I said, 'And do you believe God will surely heal you?'  They laughed, as at a jest, replying, 'Oh, yes, yes; we know He will.'  Only a few could talk plainly.  Nearly all understood conversation carried on in simple words.  One interpreted for those who wanted treatment, bringing them up to me one by one, and giving me their names.  I talked in a simple manner of God's goodness and love, and how that love destroyed evil, and of the obligations of the patients to correct their lives and obey God and love each other and be honest, etc.  All this was listened to with intense interest and noddings of approval and assent.</p>

    <p>"After the guests had departed the several men belonging to Rosalie's family went out to sleep in a shanty, leaving the cabin to the women.  I was given a comfortable bed and rested tranquilly between clean, pink calico sheets.  The next morning I started off early for a twenty-five mile drive to catch the train.</p>

    <p>"Two weeks later found me again at the log cabin.  But what a transformation!  I literally did not recognize my patients.  The Sioux Indians are afflicted with consumption and bed blood, breaking out in large blotches, and causing sore, red, weak eyes.  I left them a lean, weak, hollow-eyed, sore-bedotted crowd.  I found them fat, strong, bright-eyed, clean-skinned, and happy.  The old couple met me and I could scarce believe my eyes.  The old gentleman had been thrown from a horse seven years before, breaking two ribs from his spine.  An unsuccessful surgical operation had left them loose and constantly grating and sore, the continual torture making life miserable.  He was healed and hearty, and told me in his broken way that the ribs were knit tightly in place.  He had gained twenty pounds, and he said, 'I feel twenty-five years old.'  All vestiges of eruption had disappeared from the married daughter and husband, and their faces were full and happy.</p>

    <p>"But I looked in vain for their little boy 'Johnny', whose thin face and lean legs were sorely afflicted with the red blotches.  A robust youngster with round cheeks was playing about the room, and when I asked for Johnny his mother pointed him out, exclaiming, 'This is Johnny, but he is well now.'</p>

    <p>A boy of about sixteen with fleshy face and small twinkling eyes came to the door and stood grinning at me  I looked closely, but recognized nothing familiar in the face, and asked, 'Who is this?'  'Why, that is Sam,' they cried.  Now Sam had brought me out from Walhalla on my first visit, and had left on my mind the picture of a thin faced lad with big black eyes set into red hollows.</p>

    <p>"All consumptive symptoms prevailing among these families had disappeared.  I have since thought much about this experience.  We do not envy these people their lot, but their rapid physical transformation proves, by contrast, the tenacity of our educated beliefs, and their positive faith and its quick and astonishing results puts to shame our enlightened (?) doubt and protracted recovery.</p>

    <p>"I submit this for publication, not as any proof that these people are nearer the truth of Christian Science than others, but as a most convincing proof that human doctrines and doubts and false education make the way long and tiresome.</p>

    <p>"One fact I wish to emphasize is that I have not overdrawn the picture.  I have often thought of sending this to the Journal and have not, because it sounds like exaggeration.  Afterward another man of the Chippewa race sent for me.  He had been gored by a savage animal ten or fifteen years before and had ever since worn a leathern belt, about ten inches in width to protect the rupture.  He as a very large man.  He told me he could not lay it off for even half a day, and could not drive horses without it.  I treated him about ten o'clock at night, and he immediately took off his belt at my request and retired for the night.  The next day he drove a span of young, spirited horses through the woods and helped load logs on the sled, suffering no inconvenience from the exertion.  The rupture was healed."  (pp 301 - 303)</p>
