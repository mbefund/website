	<p>KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, <br/>
	That I, Mary Baker G. Eddy of Concord, New Hampshire, in consideration of one dollar to me paid by Henry M. Baker of Box, New Hampshire, Archibald McLellan of Boston, Massachusetts, and Josiah E. Fernald of Concord, New Hampshire, who are hereby constituted trustees and attorneys in fact for the purposes hereinafter set forth, do hereby grant, convey, assign and transfer under the said Henry M. Baker, Archibald McLellan, and Josiah E. Fernald, their heirs, successors, and assigns, all my interest of every kind and description in and to any real estate wherever situated; also all my interests of every kind and description in and to any estate, personal or mixed, which I now own or possess, including stocks, bonds, interests in copyrights, contracts, actions and causes of action at law or in equity against any person.</p>

	<p>TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the above granted and assigned premises, and all the privileges and appurtenances thereto belonging, unto said Henry M. Baker, Archibald McLellan, and Josiah E. Fernald, trustees, to them and their heirs, successors and assigns; but, in trust, nevertheless, for the following purposes and upon the following conditions, viz.:</p>

	<p>First: To manage, care for, and control all the above granted real estate and interest therein during my earthly life and, at the termination thereof, to dispose of the same in accordance with the provisions of my last will and the codicils thereto; but I hereby reserve for myself the right of occupancy and use of my homestead, ‘Pleasant View,’ in Concord, New Hampshire.  I hereby also reserve all household furniture, my printed library, and all horses, carriages, tools, and other articles of use or adornment now being or in use in or about my home premises at ‘Pleasant View’.  I hereby also reserve the right to occupy and to rent for my own benefit my two houses at 385 and 387 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Mass.</p>

	<p>Second: I give unto my trustees full power to manage, care for, control, invest and reinvest all said trust property and the income thereof with all powers necessary or convenient for such purpose, desiring, however, that investments of income and reinvestments of principle shall always be made in bonds or other securities of a conservative character, having regard for the safety of the principle.  It is my wish that, in the making of investments, preference shall be given to the state, government, city and municipal bonds; but I leave this to the judgment and discretion of said trustees, relying upon said discretion being conservatively exercised.</p>

	<p>Third: Said trustees shall pay to me, from time to time, out of the net income of said trust property, (1) such sums as I may need or desire for the purpose of keeping up the homestead ‘Pleasant View,’ and paying the expenses thereof and of my household, in the same general way as heretofore; (2) such sums as I may desire for my own personal expenses and for charitable purposes; and (3) such sums as I may personally desire to use for the advancement of the cause and doctrines of Christian Science as taught by me.  Said trustees shall also pay and discharge whatever claims and accounts may be outstanding against me at this date.</p>

	<p>Fourth: At the termination of my earthly life, this trust shall terminate, and all the personal estate then held by my said trustees shall pass to the executor of my last will and the codicils thereto, to be disposed of in accordance with the provisions thereof.</p>

	<p>Fifth: Said trustees are hereby appointed my attorneys in fact and, as such, are hereby vested with full power and authority for me and in my behalf and in behalf of the trust estate hereby created, either in their own names as trustees or in my name, as they shall decide, to bring, appear in, prosecute, defend, and dispose of, as in their judgment shall seem best for the protection and preservation of the trust estate, any actions, causes of action, suits at law or in equity, whether now pending <mark>or hereafter brought with reference to any matter in which I may be personally interested or the trust estate hereby created</mark> in any way affected.  And I hereby give to my trustees and attorneys in fact full power and authority to employ attorneys-at-law and other agents in such matters and in all other matters pertaining to the trust estate.</p>

	<p>Sixth: In case of a vacancy in said board of trustees, caused by death, <mark>refusal to act</mark>, or resignation of any of them, or for any reason, <mark>a new trustee or trustees shall be appointed by me and, in case I fail to act, said new trustee shall be appointed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire</mark> for the time being, preference being given to the nomination of the remaining trustee or trustees.</p>

	<p>Seventh: I direct that <mark>my trustees shall be liable only for their own acts</mark> in the management of this trust and that no trustee shall be answerable for loss or damage which may happen to the trust property without <mark>his own wilful fault or misfeasance.</mark></p>

	<p>Eighth: I desire said <mark>trustees and their successors to furnish a surety bond [see following] or bonds to the amount of five hundred thousand dollars</mark>, and the expenses thereof shall be paid from the trust funds.</p>

	<p>Ninth:  The trustees shall receive a reasonable payment from the trust fund for their personal services as such, and shall also be reimbursed for all expenses incurred by them in the management of the trust estate.</p>

	<p>Tenth: The trustees shall render to me personally, semi-annual accounts of the trust property and the income and expense thereof.</p>

	<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and seal this sixth day of March, A.D. 1907.</p>
