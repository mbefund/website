    <p>KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS<br/>
        THAT WHEREAS I, Mary Baker G. Eddy of Concord in the County of Merrimack in the State of New Hampshire, did, on the twenty-fifty day of January one thousand and eight hundred and ninety-eight, convey two parcels of land with the buildings thereon, being lots I and H on a plan made by William H Whitney dated December 30, 1886 and recorded with Suffolk Deeds, Book 1756, page 17, the grantee named in said conveyance being “The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Mass., a corporation duly established under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts”; and</p>

    <p>WHEREAS it has now been brought to my attention that said grantee was not a corporation, but said <mark>Church is a voluntary association of individuals, the title to the Church property being vested in a board of trustees named in the deeds of trust</mark> by me conveying the land upon which is situated the edifice in which said Church worships, said deed of trust being dated September 1st 1892 and recorded in Suffolk Registry of Deeds, Book 2081 page 257; and</p>

    <p>WHEREAS said deed of January 25, 1898 conveying said lots I and H was delivered to and accepted by said Board of Trustees, and said Trustees have been in the actual possession of the property since the date of said conveyance and are now about to build an additional church edifice upon said two lots and adjoining property held by them; and</p>

    <p>WHEREAS I now desire to modify the reservation to me contained in said deed of a right of occupation of a portion of said premises, and I further desire to correct the error in the description of the grantee named in the said deed and to add to the trusts upon which this property is to be held; </p>

    <p>NOW THEREFORE I, the said Mary Baker G. Eddy, in consideration of one dollar and other good and valuable considerations to me in hand paid by Ira O. Knapp, William B.

    <p>With reference to the reservation in said deed of January 25, 1898 of which the following is a copy;<br/>
        namely “Reserving however the right to have and occupy so much room conveniently and pleasantly located in the publishing house as may be necessary to carry on the publication and sale of the books of which I am or may be the author, and other literature connected therewith”;  I for myself, my executors and assigns do hereby agree with said Ira O. Knapp, William B. Johnson, Joseph Armstrong and Stephen A. Chase, as present trustees and as said Christian Science Board of Directors, and with their successors in said trust, that the rights so reserved in said deed of January 25, 1898 shall be suspended, and unenforceable so long and for such times as said Christian Science Board of Directors and their successors shall provide free of expense to me, my executors and assigns for rent and storage, suitable rooms conveniently and pleasantly located in the Christian Science publishing house as may be necessary to carry on the publication and sale of books of which I am or may be the author, and other literature connected therewith.</p>

    <p>In addition to the trusts contained in said deed of September 1, 1892 <mark>this property is conveyed on the further trusts that no new tenet or By Law shall be adopted nor any tenet or By Law amended or annulled by the grantees unless the written consent of said Mary Baker G.

    <p>To have and to hold the said remised premises and said reservation to the said Ira O. Knapp, William B. Johnson, Joseph Armstrong and Stephen A. Chase, as they are the Christian Science Board of Directors, their successors in said trust, and assigns forever, upon the trusts aforesaid and upon the trusts <mark>but not subject to the conditions mentioned in said deed creating said Board, dated September 1, 1892 with all the powers therein contained, including the power to appoint new trustees by filling vacancies in said Board as in said deed expressed.</mark></p>
