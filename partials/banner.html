	<h2>Arbitration Hearing Results</h2>

	<p>A decision by Justice Elaine M. Moriarty of the Probate and Family Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, regarding the request by the Christian Science Board of Directors that Maryfrances Cassell be required to pay their attorney’s fees was released on July 9, 2013.  The Board of Directors had requested that Miss Cassell be ordered to pay $47,800.  Judge Moriarty reduced the fees to $30,500 and required her to pay within 120 days.</p>

	<p>In the “Discussion” portion of the decision, the judge stated: “Ms. Cassell is part of a restoration group within the Christian Science community who disagree with the actions of the Board concerning the governance of the Church.  Specifically, she and others object to the Board’s authorization of use of the Boston church for other than Christian Science purposes and for, in her view, failing to adhere to the governing documents of the Church.  [...]  Furthermore, as noted by the Appeals Court, her contention that the Board members are merely fiduciaries of a trust established by [Mrs] Eddy ‘is flawed ... because [Mrs]Eddy’s deed of trust only covers a conveyance of land; it does not establish the judicial policing of church membership ...   Ms. Cassell’s multiple attempts to control the Board’s actions, despite the clear, well-established law prohibiting the relief requested show that the present action is frivolous and not advanced in good faith.” [emphasis added]</p>

	<p>In response to the Board’s motion for attorney fees, Miss Cassell’s attorney, Robert B. Eyre wrote: “... the same Church Manual that gives the Defendants power to act on Plaintiff’s [Miss Cassell’s] membership also imposes a duty on members of The Mother Church to steward the Mary Baker Eddy Trust and complain about their misconduct.  The Defendants were intended and bound to be subservient to the Governing Documents authorised by Mrs. Eddy, not the masters of them.  If they are masters of their own Governing Documents – as they claim to be – then they are not Trustees or fiduciaries at all, but owners of the assets and the Trust has failed.  Plaintiff’s entire purpose was to defend the principle of membership and, through that, preserve the Trust from that failure by restoring some semblance of accountability of the Directors to someone other than themselves.”</p>

	<h2>Deeds and Church Manual ignored</h2>

	<p>The Directors insist that they are bound only by the 1892 Deed of Trust which is a conveyance of the land upon which the original Mother Church edifice stands.  The Directors and Judge Moriarty adamantly ignore Mrs. Eddy’s Deed of Trust of 1903 [printed in the Church Manual on pages 136-138], as well as the long hidden and suppressed Deeds of 1904, 1905, and 1906.</p>

	<p>Mrs Eddy specifically links her 1904 Deed of Trust to the previous Deeds of 1892 and 1903.  She states in the 1904 Deed: “... nothing herein contained shall ever be construed as a waiver or as permitting a modification in any degree the further trusts set forth ... wherein it is provided that no new tenet or by-law shall be added nor any tenet or by-law amended or annulled by the grantees [the Directors], unless the written consent of said Mary Baker G. Eddy, the author of the text book ‘Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures’ be given therefor ...”</p>

	<h2>The Case will go forward</h2>

	<p>This case has always been about the restoration of Mrs. Eddy’s rights to her own Church as stated in her Deeds of Trust, By-laws, and Tenets.  Preparations are underway to reintroduce this case in another venue.</p>
