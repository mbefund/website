	<p>TO THE CONTRIBUTORS OF THE CHURCH BUILDING FUND IN BOSTON   by Mary Baker Eddy

	<p>The glorious object you have attempted to achieve, must not be abandoned until it be accomplished.  It is far too vital to the present and future welfare of Christian Science, to be left undone.</p>

	<p>Both lawyers, Mr Griffin of Boston, and Mr Streeter of Concord, agree that Mr Knapp’s deed was deficient, solely on the question, as to whether this deed created a public, <mark>or a private trust</mark>.  Mr Knapp has always been willing to quitclaim the minor points – his wife’s dower (which was a legal blunder), and his heir’s claims, but being himself limited in trust, he could not settle the question of ownership.  When this first deed was executed, the church was in such a condition, that it troubled me to know whether to donate my lot to the church, or <mark>to Christian Scientists in general.</mark></p>

	<p>When the Building Fund had reached thirty thousand dollars, I urged the Trustees to commence building, this they refused on the grounds of having an unsafe title.  I then suggested again the steps to be taken for perfecting this title, steps which they have since, in substance, accepted.</p>

	<p>Another cause of delay was alleged – the necessity of organizing a church, to which the land could be donated.  About six weeks ago I called for legal counsel and engaged two able lawyers in my native state.  Guided by the Divine Love they found in the laws of Massachusetts the statute referred to in the following deed (and which is herewith published) for incorporating a body of donees, without organizing a church.</p>

	<p>Truly, God’s ways are not man’s ways; and faith in the Divine methods are indeed the footsteps of the flock.  What joy might now crown this faith had it taken firmly the first steps and held on, till it clasped God’s right hand.</p>

	<p>All loyal Christian Scientists will be pleased to know, that we can have and hold church property <mark>without going back to outgrown forms of church organization.</mark></p>

	<p>Setting aside all personal interests, - and without a single obligation on my part, - sparing neither time nor money, I have the second time obtained for our church in Boston, a pacific settlement, and a legal title to go on and build a church edifice in the interest of Christian Science.  I specially request the contributors to recall every cent they have contributed and forward at once the amount to our Trustees or the Board of Directors.  Remember it was the Boston <span class="italics">Church Building</span> Fund for which you were legally asked to contribute and it is this now.</p>

	<p>Beloved contributors, please consider, that “to err is human, to forgive Divine.”  My students who composed the honourable Boards of Directors and Trustees have, without a murmur, labored hard in the discharge of their offices; and I fervently hope they will reap a rich reward from experience, be abundantly blessed for every right motive, and long enjoy the good that has been accomplished.</p>

	<p>It is alleged, that it has been said, this article shall not be published.  “He giveth His angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways.”  The power that overruled the writing of SCIENCE AND HEALTH, is, <mark>to my sense, overruling and compelling this simple statement of facts.</mark></p>

	<p>Many, many thanks to the noble contributors for their liberality, patience and fidelity.  The following is a copy of <mark>my deed of trust.</mark></p>

	<ol>
		<li>Said grantees shall be known as the “Christian Science Board of Directors,” and shall constitute a perpetual body or corporation under and in accordance with section one, Chapter 39 of the Public Statutes of Massachusetts. <sub>(1)</sub>  Whenever a vacancy occurs in said Board the remaining members shall within thirty days fill the same by election; but no one shall be eligible to that office who is not in the opinion of the remaining members of the Board a firm and consistent believer in the doctrines of Christian Science as taught in a book entitled “SCIENCE AND HEALTH,” by Mary Baker G. Eddy beginning with the seventy-first edition thereof.
			<p><sub>(1) The deacons, church wardens, or other similar officers of churches or other religious societies, and the trustees of the Methodist Episcopal churches appointed according to the discipline and usages thereof, shall, if citizens of this commonwealth, be deemed bodies corporate for the purpose of taking and holding in succession all the grants and donations, whether of real or personal estate, made either to them and their successors, or to their respective churches, or to the poor of the churches.</sub></p></li>
		<li>Said Board shall within five years from the date hereof build or cause to be built upon said lot of land a suitable and convenient church edifice, the cost of which shall not be less than fifty thousand dollars.</li>
		<li>When said church building is completed said Board shall elect a pastor, reader or speaker to fill the pulpit who shall be a genuine Christian Scientist; they shall maintain public worship in accordance with the doctrines of Christian Science in said church, and for this purpose they are fully empowered to make any and all necessary rules and regulations.</li>
		<li>Said Board of Directors shall not suffer or allow any building to be erected upon said lot except a church building or edifice, nor shall they allow said church building or any part thereof to be used for any other purpose than for the ordinary and usual uses of a church.</li>
		<li>Said Board of Directors shall not allow or permit in said church building any preaching or other religious services which shall not be consonant and in strict harmony with the doctrines and practice of Christian Science as taught and explained by Mary Baker G. Eddy in the seventy-first edition of her book entitled “SCIENCE AND HEALTH,” which is soon to be issued, and in any subsequent edition thereof.</li>
		<li><mark>The congregation which shall worship in said church shall be styled “The First Church of Christ, Scientist.”</mark></li>
		<li>Said Directors shall not sell or mortgage the land thereby conveyed; but they shall see that all taxes and legal assessments on said property are promptly paid.</li>
		<li>Said church building shall not be removed from said lot except for the purpose of rebuilding thereon a more expensive or a more convenient structure in which said doctrines of Christian Science only shall be preached and practised.  If said church building is removed for either of the purposes above set forth, any and all tablets and inscriptions which are or shall be upon said church building at the time of removal shall be removed therefrom and placed upon the walls of the new edifice.  If said building is burned, the Directors shall forthwith proceed to rebuild the church.</li>
		<li>Said Directors shall maintain regular preaching, reading or speaking in said church on each Sabbath, and an omission to have and maintain such preaching, reading or speaking for one year in succession shall be deemed a breach of this condition.</li>
		<li>Whenever said Directors shall determine that it is inexpedient to maintain preaching, reading or speaking in said church in accordance with the terms of this deed, they are authorized and required to reconvey forthwith said lot of land with the building thereon to Mary Baker G. Eddy, her heirs and assigns forever by a proper deed of conveyance.</li>
		<li>The omission or neglect on the part of said Directors to strictly comply with any of the conditions herein contained shall constitute a breach thereof, and the title hereby conveyed shall revert to the grantor Mary Baker G. Eddy, her heirs and assigns forever, upon her entry upon said land and taking possession thereof for such breach.</li>

	</ol>

	<p>To Have and to Hold the above granted premises with all the privileges and appurtenances thereon belonging to said grantees and their successors in office to the uses and trusts above described forever.
