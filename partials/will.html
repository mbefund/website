	</header>
	
	<p>BE IT KNOWN THAT I, Mary Baker G. Eddy, of Concord, Hew Hampshire, being of sound and disposing mind and memory, do make, publish and declare this to be my last will and testament in manner and form following, that is to say;</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>I hereby nominate and appoint Honourable <mark>Henry M. Baker</mark> of Bow, New Hampshire, sole executor of this my last will and testament; and, having ample confidence in his ability and integrity, I desire that <mark>he shall not be required to furnish sureties on his official bond.</mark></li>
		<li>Having already transferred and given to my son, George W. Glover, of Lead City, South Dakota, four certain mortgage deeds bought of the Farmers Loan and Trust Company, of the State of Kansas, and having already given him a house and lot located in Lead City, South Dakota, and monies at various times, I hereby confirm and ratify said transfers and gifts, and, in addition thereto, I give and bequeath to my said son, George W. Glover, the sum of ten thousand dollars.</li>
		<li>I give and bequeath to George H. Moore, of Concord, New Hampshire, the sum of one thousand dollars; to each of the five children of my son, George W. Glover, the sum of ten thousand dollars; to Mrs Mary A. Baker, of Boston, Massachusetts, widow of my late brother, the sum of five thousand dollars; to Frances A. Baker, of Concord, New Hampshire, the sum of one thousand dollars; to Henrietta E. Chanfrau, of Philadelphia, Penn., the sum of one thousand dollars; to Fred N. Ladd, of Concord, New Hampshire the sum of three thousand dollars; to my adopted son, Benjamin J. Foster, M.D., the sum of five thousand dollars; to Calvin A. Frye, of Concord, New Hampshire, the sum of ten thousand dollars, provided he continues in my service to the date of my decease; to Pauline Mann, of Concord, New Hampshire, the sum of one thousand dollars, provided she continues in my service to the date of my decease; to Joseph G. Mann, of Concord, New Hampshire, three thousand dollars, provided he continues in my service to the date of my decease; to Laura E. Sargent, of Concord, New Hampshire, three thousand dollars, provided she continues in my service to the date of my decease.</li>
		<li>I give and bequeath <mark>to The Mother Church - First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts, the sum of fifty thousand dollars.</mark></li>
		<li><p>I give and devise to Calvin A. Frye and Joseph G. Mann, above named, provided they shall respectively remain in my service to the date of my decease, the right, during the term of their respective natural lives, to occupy and use my homestead and grounds called "Pleasant View", in Concord, New Hampshire, as their residence and home, but the rights hereby conditionally granted to said Frye and Mann shall not be assignable to any other person. Said homestead and grounds connected therewith shall not be leased to, or occupied by, any persons, except as herein provided. No part of said homestead, or lands connected therewith, shall be devoted to any other uses or purposes than those of a home for said Frye and Mann during their respective lives (provided they respectively remain in my service to the date of my decease) and a home for my grandchildren according to the terms of this will and, after the termination of the rights of said Frye and Mann and my grandchildren as herein provided, as a place for the reception, entertainment and care of Christian Science visitors and their friends, and to such other purposes looking to the general advancement of the Christian Science religion as may be deemed best by the residuary legatee. All the personal property, except my jewelry, in and about said homestead and lands shall be kept and carefully used on said premises. In my contract with Edward A. Kimball, of Chicago, dated October 9, 1899, provision is made for the creation of a trust fund for the purpose of procuring an annual revenue or income which shall be used for maintaining in a perpetual state of repair my said homestead. A further provision is also made for that purpose in said contract. If for any reason, sufficient funds for said purposes shall not be provided from the sources named in said contract, then I direct that my residuary legatee shall provide and expend such sums, from time to time, as may be necessary for the purpose of maintaining said homestead and grounds in a perpetual state of repair and cultivation.</p> 
		
		<p>I hereby give and devise to my grandson, George W. Glover, Jr., the right and privilege of living and having a home at Pleasant View and of being supported therein in a reasonable manner at the expense of my estate while he is obtaining his education preparatory to admission to Dartmouth College, provided he shall select and choose to obtain his education at that institution. I also direct my executor to pay all of said George W. Glover, Jr's. reasonable expenses while at said college, giving him, in the meantime, the privilege of a home at Pleasant View.</p>
		
		<p>I also give and devise to my grand-daughters the right and privilege of living and having a home at Pleasant View, and of being supported therein in a reasonable manner at the expense of my estate, while they, or either of them, are obtaining a high school education, provided they, or either of them, desire the advantages of such course.</p></li>
		<li><p>I give and bequeath <mark>to The Christian Science Board of Directors</mark> of The Mother Church - The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts - and their successors in office, the sum of <mark>one hundred thousand dollars</mark>, but, nevertheless, in trust for the following purposes, namely; said trustees shall hold, invest, and reinvest the principal of said fund and conservatively manage the same, and shall use the income and such portion of the principal, from time to time, as they may deem best, for the purpose of providing free instruction for indigent, well educated, worthy Christian Scientists at the Massachusetts Metaphysical College and to aid them thereafter until they can maintain themselves in some department of Christian Science.</p>
		
		<p>I desire that the instruction for which provision is hereby made shall be at the said College, but my said trustees are hereby authorized to provide said instruction elsewhere, if, in the unanimous judgement of all said trustees for the time being, such course shall seem best. The judgement and discretion of said trustees with reference to the persons to be aided as herein provided and the amount of aid furnished to each of said persons shall be final and conclusive.</p></li>
