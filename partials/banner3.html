    <h2>DEMAND TO INSPECT BOOKS AND RECORDS</h2>

    <p>A letter to the Christian Science Board of Directors and the Committee on Finance dated March 19, 2015, was delivered on March 20th via Federal Express.  The letter was written on behalf of unnamed members of The Mother Church “for the purpose of investigating suspected violations of the fiduciary and contractual obligations of the Directors, members of the Committee on Finance (the “Committee”) and/or other officers of The Mother Church, including possible misuse and gross mismanagement of the Trusts’ assets ...</p>

    <p>“Our clients have a good faith basis to suspect that the Directors, members of the Committee and officers of The Mother Church may have violated those duties.  Our clients, therefore, must be permitted the inspection described below, and if it is determined that their suspicion of transgressions are manifest, then proper corrective actions may be taken ...”</p>

    <p>The letter cites Church Manual Article I, Section 9; Article XXIV, Sections 2 and 4 to justify these requests.  Also Article XI, Sections 3, 4, 6, 7 are cited as to the duties of the Clerk when specific complaints of misconduct are lodged.  The letter also notes: “Finally, the By-Laws require that ‘The Mother Church shall not be made legally responsible for the debts of individuals ...[,]’ and that the Committee shall have the books of both the Board and the Treasurer audited annually, and the Board shall ‘have the books of the Church Treasurer audited semi-annually, [so as] to report at the annual Church meeting the amount of funds which the Church has on hand, the amount of its indebtedness and of its expenditures for the last year.’ ...</p>

    <p>“Based on a review of the annual financial statements for previous years, The Mother Church has experienced severe asset value reduction and worsening operating losses that appear to be the result of conduct not in the ordinary course of the business of The Mother Church.  Put another way, these deviations probably resulted directly from conduct amounting to breaches of fiduciary duty, such as misappropriation or other gross mismanagement.  In addition, our clients have a good faith basis to believe that members of the Board or Committee have treated The Mother Church’s assets as their own, paying themselves unjustly and, indeed, have entrenched themselves by transferring seats of leadership to friends or family members ...</p>

    <p>“Finally, until a formal complaint may be made, our clients remain anonymous in view of a pattern of summary punishments, including removal from the membership rolls of The Mother Church, levied against members who have raised the same concerns echoed in the Demand ...</p>

    <p>“If you have not responded by 5.00 p.m. EDT on Monday, April 21, 2015, our clients will assume that you do not intend to comply with this Demand and will proceed accordingly.”</p>

    <h2>FRANK STREETER’S 1915 LETTER</h2>

    <p>Mrs Eddy’s longtime lawyer, Frank S. Streeter, wrote a letter to the Board of Directors on September 8, 1915: “Shortly before the middle of July, [Board chairman] Mr McLellan conferred with me relative to the proposals made in the board to make certain readjustments and specifically to increase the salaries of board members from $2500, the amount now limited by Section 8 of the By-Laws, to $8000 or $10,000 and to do this without changing the By-Law and without notice to or knowledge of the church members ...</p>

    <p>“No other board in the English-speaking world is vested with such a combination of exclusive and unrevisable power over the spiritual and property concerns as this board seems to possess on the face of the creating documents.  I use the word ‘seems’ advisedly because I am convinced that these powers although not so intended are not immutable, but are probably subject to change or modification if occasion therefor arises ...</p>

    <p>“The organisation of the Mother Church rests upon the powers conferred by general statute combined with powers created by the Founder.  In all church organizations resting on the statute, the ultimate management and control of all the temporal and spiritual concerns of the church is vested solely in the beneficiaries, namely, the Church members.</p>

    <p>“If the Church members or any considerable number thereof shall be aroused to challenge at law the board’s power of exclusive control conferred by the Founder in disregard of the statutes on which the Church is based and which confer exclusive control on the members, this question of power of control by the board conferred by the Founder, or power of control by the Church members conferred by the statutes will immediately be raised ....”</p>

    <p>In a separate memo dated July 20, 1915, Mr Streeter wrote, “If the members of this Church, or any group or faction, should become aware of some of the things recently done and said and largely shown by your [the Board’s] records, you might reasonably expect an effort made either to change the power of control from the board to the Church members, or to change the personnel of the board itself ...</p>

    <p>“If any member thinks me impertinent or presumptuous in presenting these views, let me remind him that my connection with the fortunes of this Church at highly critical periods, when its Founder, its doctrines and its property were viciously assailed and its fortunes seemed to hang in the balance, may afford some justification for my present desire that this organization shall not be disrupted, but shall be preserved to carry on the great work in accordance with the hopes and intentions of the Founder ...”  (Proceedings in Equity 1919-1921, pages 735-739)</p>

    <p>The Banner was informed in 2006 that the Board members were paying themselves $200,000 each per year or $1,000,000 for all five of them.  (See Spring 2006 issue for discussion of Board salaries.)</p>

    <h2>CASSELL FOUNDATION WILL CONTINUE</h2>

    <p>A letter from Maryfrances Cassell dated February 5, 2010, announced the organization of the Novus Ordo Seclorum Foundation whose purpose is “to reinstate the original organization as founded by the Deed of 1892 and preserved in the Church Manual by Mary Baker Eddy as Pastor Emeritus in perpetuity.”  The foundation’s name was one of four inscriptions on the granite marker at Mrs Eddy’s birthplace and is an adaptation of a phrase appearing in the epic poem, The Aeneid, by the Roman poet Vergil.  This poem recounted the mythical founding of the Roman republic and was a favorite of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and other founding fathers of The United States.  This also explains the motto’s appearance on the Great Seal of The United States.  With the passing of Miss Cassell, the litigation is now in other hands, but one other purpose of her foundation remains to be accomplished: the restoration of the marker at Mary Baker Eddy’s birthplace at Bow, New Hampshire.</p>

    <p>“In 1962, the Board of Directors voted to demolish the pyramid marker at the site of Mary Baker Eddy’s birth in Bow, New Hampshire.  After Mrs Eddy’s passing, James F Lord had acquired the property of the old Baker homestead ...  He improved the site, erected the monument and donated the property to the Mother Church in 1927.  His efforts had never been viewed with favour by the Directors, and the monument was never included in notices of historic sites occasionally listed in the Journal.  A photograph, however, was included in the book, Landmarks from Bow to Boston.  The precisely carved granite was the largest single piece ever quarried in New Hampshire, and, despite its official lack of approval, it attracted many visitors over the years since its dedication on the centennial of Mrs Eddy’s birth on July 16, 1921.</p>

    <p>“Workmen at the site had prepared to blast the monument with dynamite as instructed by the Directors [in 1962 presumably when word of Mr Lord’s passing had been verified].  At the last minute, L Ivimy Gwalter [Maryfrances Cassell’s teacher], a member of the Board who did not want it destroyed, persuaded her fellow Directors to postpone the destruction, and word was immediately sent to New Hampshire.  But the message arrived too late, and the destructive deed was done.  The fragments were buried somewhere to prevent souvenir seekers from getting any of the pieces.  This was in keeping with the Directors’ policy established with the destruction [by controlled burning] of Mrs Eddy’s home at Pleasant View [in 1917] when every fragment of the house was taken away and secretly buried to thwart those who wanted some tangible remembrance.”  (Christian Science After 1910, by Andrew W. Hartsook, p 116)</p>

    <p>Perhaps anticipating all of this, Mary Baker Eddy wrote a letter less than two weeks before her passing dated November 20, 1910, in which she stated: <strong>Know all men by this protest that no change shall be made on the grounds that I own without my consent in writing.</strong></p>

    <p>Mrs Eddy also wrote in March 1893, “Justice, a prominent statute in the divine law, demands of all trespassers upon the sparse individual rights which one justly reserves to one’s self, - Would you consent that others should tear up your landmarks, manipulate your students, nullify or reverse your rules, countermand your orders, steal your possessions, and escape the penalty therefor?  No!  ‘Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.’” (Miscellaneous Writings, page 119:24)</p>
